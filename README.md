# Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website! This project showcases my skills, experiences, achievements and projects. Below you will find detailed information about the technologies used, file structure, responsiveness, and how to access my website.

## Why I Use React Framework

I chose React for this project due to its component-based architecture, which allows for reusable and maintainable code. React's virtual DOM ensures efficient updates and rendering, leading to a smoother user experience. Additionally, React's rich ecosystem and community support make it an excellent choice for building modern web applications.

## Is the Website Responsive?

No, the website is not responsive. You may have different view depending on your device.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several components and directories for better maintainability:

    src/components: Contains all React components, such as Header, Footer, Experience, and Projects.
    src/assets: Stores images, icons, and other static assets.
    src/styles: Includes CSS modules for styling components.
    src/data: Contains JSON files with data for skills and history (now embedded directly in components).
    src/utils: Utility functions, like getImageUrl.
    public: Public assets and the main HTML file.


Main Components

```
    App.js: The root component that includes the main layout and routing.
    Header.js: Displays the navigation bar and logo.
    Footer.js: Contains the footer content.
    Experience.js: Showcases my skills and professional history.
    Projects.js: Lists my personal and professional projects.
```
## How to Access the Website

Currently i haven't hosted my website anywhere as it is in development. But in future i will surely host it and will update the things on this repo.

## What is the Purpose of This Website?

The purpose of this website is to showcase my professional skills, work experience, and projects. It serves as an online portfolio for potential employers and collaborators to learn more about me and my work.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Welcome to my Portfolio code, the build of the code is done mainly in Javascript using react Framework.
